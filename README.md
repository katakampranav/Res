# ReSculpt - Market

Today, we face a big problem with a lot of waste in our society, which is harmful to people and animals. This happens because we buy and throw away things quickly, especially things we use once and then throw away. The way we get rid of our trash also makes the problem worse. Our plan is to improve how we deal with waste by turning things we use at home into new and useful things. This way, we can use them again instead of throwing them away. This not only helps the environment but also lets us create cool and useful items for our homes.

## Problem Statement

Empowering Sustainable Practices: Bridging Waste Contributors and Artisans Through an Innovative Upcycling App.


## Solution

**1) App for Artisans :**
We generate a significant amount of household waste regularly.
This waste can be repurposed to create decorative and innovative products by collaborating with skilled artisans.
Anyone can contribute their household waste for this purpose, fostering a sense of community engagement.

**2) App for Uploading Innovative products:**
Artisans can sell the creative products they make through a dedicated marketplace app.
This app exclusively focuses on providing a platform for showcasing and selling innovative products crafted by artisans.

## Tech Stack

**Flutter** : Front-end framework 

**Firebase** : Back-end as a service
